## Article : 

Children who **grow up** on **farms** have a lower risk of developing asthma, and now it **seems** that may be due to microbes that can also be found in **urban and suburban homes**.

Pirkka Kirjavainen at **the National Institute for Health and Welfare** in Finland and his colleagues analysed the microbes from **living room** **floor** dust from the homes of a group of 197 children living in **rural areas** of Finland – half living on farms – and 182 children living in suburban or urban places.

**They took** these **samples** when the children were 2 months old and **likely** **to be crawling**, and **therefore** exposed to microbes on the floor. Then they **followed up** at 6 years old to see how many children were **diagnosed** with asthma.

For the rural group there was a clear difference in the **dust** found in farms compared to other homes. The dust from farm homes had a **high variety of bacteria**, **including** **those** from **cattle** that were not present in **non-farm homes**. Non-farm homes had a higher proportion of **human-associated bacteria**, including members of the Streptococcaceae family and **Straphylococcus genus**.

These differences were associated with differences in asthma **rates**, with asthma being **rarest** **among** children **brought up** on farms. About 19 **per cent** of the children on non-farm homes had asthma, **while** only 9 per cent of kids on farms did. “**Where** there are more **outdoor microbes** and a low **abundance** of human microbes, we see **lower** asthma rates,” says Kirjavainen.

For the suburban children, they found that the homes with a microbial community that was most like that of farm homes were **correlated** with a lower risk of asthma in the children at age 6, when asthma **tends to** develop.

“There is an indication that early life **exposure** **matters** the most. Later exposure would seem to have an influence on asthma, but this is the optimal **window** to measure,” says Kirjavainen.

When the team studied blood samples from the children, **they found** that those in homes with more farm-like bacteria didn’t produce **immune responses** to the bacteria, so they **tolerate** them better. The team then **replicated** this study with a group of 1031 German children, and found the same **relationship** between farm-like microbes in non-farm homes and a reduced risk of **childhood** asthma.

Kirjavainen says there was a small association between having **pets** and farm-like microbes in the home, which could be due to the animals **bringing** in **soil particles**. The team saw no effect when they took into account **gender**, parental allergies, **maternal education**, **smoking during pregnancy**, or the number of **siblings** a child had. The next **step** is **to determine** what it is about the microbes that **make them beneficial**, and potentially **devise** a **therapy** that could **induce**  these immune system effects in children.

|**Remaining questions** |What is it about the microbes that make them beneficial? What could be the treatment that would induce these effects on the immune system of children?|
